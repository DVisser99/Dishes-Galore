      <h2>Section 1: Scrape</h2>
      <p>Remove as much food residue as possible by scraping plates and bowls with a utensil, dumping the contents into your trash bin.</p>

      <h2>Section 2: Soak</h2>
      <p>Set your faucet to hot and soak your plates and bowls in the hot water.  Place your utensils on top of your plates and bowls.  Soaking your dishes and silverware in hot water will loosen any remaining food residue.  Let your dishes soak for 30 minutes.</p>
